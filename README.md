# GitHub-Action-CI-CD-YAML

GitHub Action and CI/CD Course Project - YAML

# Project Topic
- GitHub Actions workflow that automates the deployment of a Node.js application to a production environment. 

 # Step 1: Creating my repository**  

 - starting  by creating a new repository on GitHub. This is where all my project files and workflow configurations will be stored.

 # Step 2: Clone the repository

 - Next i  clone the repository to my local machine using `git clone`. This allows me to work on my project files locally before pushing changes back to GitHub.

# Step 3: Creating a workflow 

- I create a workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/main.yml`). This YAML file defines the automation steps that GitHub Actions will run, such as installing dependencies, building, and testing my code.

# Step 4: Adding script to the workflow

- I add steps in my workflow file to automate tasks. Common steps include checking out my code, setting up Node.js, installing dependencies with `npm install`, running build scripts, and executing tests.*

# Step 5: Open package.json and add script 

- I edit my `package.json` file to ensure it contains the necessary `build` and `test` scripts. These scripts are called by the workflow to build and test my project automatically.

# Step 6: Facing error

*If there is a problem (such as a missing file or a script error), the workflow will fail. i can view detailed error logs in the GitHub Actions tab to help me troubleshoot and fix the issue.

# Step 7: Fixing and working 

 - After fixing the errors, i push my changes again. The workflow is now complete successfully, showing green check marks for each step in the Actions tab.

 # Project Summary 


This project provides a practical guide to implementing CI/CD for a Node.js application using GitHub Actions and YAML. By following each step, i learn how to automate my development workflowâ€”from repository setup, through workflow creation, to troubleshooting and successful build verification.  
With this setup, every code change is automatically built and tested, helping me catch errors early and maintain high code quality.  
The visual steps and explanations make it easy for anyone to understand and replicate a modern CI/CD pipeline for their own projects.
